# ywf-bot
A custom bot made specifically for my Discord server named Young, Wild and Free.

This is the official repository for the source code of the bot which is written in Skript. A Minecraft plugin made to connect with Discord. Thus you're able to host the bot through a running Minecraft server. The documentation can be found on the official Njol skript website (http://en.njol.ch/projects/skript/doc) or on the more modern website (which is a fork) (https://docs.skunity.com/)

The syntax is meant to be very easy to read even without any programming knowledge. So here it is, open source for you all!
